THIS CODE IS COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE CODERS JUST ADDING THEIR THINGS!
SO HOW THIS CODE WORKS CAN HEAVILY VARY FROM FILE TO FILE!!!

If you wish to use this plugin for your own server, please keep all the credits that are here or i WILL cry.
Do not go above 12 players(you can have 32 slots, i recommend 16+) but dont allow more inside the plugin itself (Inside queue.sp), as the server doesnt support that interms of performance, the npc's are limited at 32 for a reason.
The performance heavy things are Lagcompensation and pathfinder, but i tried to optimise those as much as i could.
Most of the code is made towards client prediction to make the best experience.

Also keep in mind that i (artvin) started coding here with only half a year of knowledege so you'll see a fuckton of shitcode.

Current coders that in anyway actively helped, in order of how much:

Batfoxkid
Artvin
Mikusch (Gamedata assistance and more, a savior.)
Suza
Alex
Spookmaster
Kenzzer (Got gamedata and make an extention edit for us)
Pelipoika (Npc base code that we heavily edited, thank you SO much for publishing it all.)


Alot of code is borrowed/just takes from other plugins i or friends made, often with permission,
rarely without cus i couldnt contact the person or it was just open sourcecode, credited anyways when i did that.

You will also see alot of "inconsistent indentation" warnings, if 1.11 compiler told me where this shit happend then i would fix it
but i honestly dont got the patience to look though all these sub files (more then 100)


There is also an escapemode Verison of this gamemode and more to come. If you need help, ask me questions, and i will awnser them and put a FAQ here too so i dont have to repeat myself.


IF you wish to see the plugin in action/or just are interrested in playing this gamemode rather then coding/messing with it, the main server for the plugin is this one hosted by disc.ff:
